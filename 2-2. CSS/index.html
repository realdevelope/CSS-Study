                he World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
                documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
                (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext,
                and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred
                via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software
                application called a web browser, and are published by a software application
                called a web server. The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet,
                which pre-existed the Web in some form by over two decades and upon whose
                technologies the Web is built.
